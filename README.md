## ðŸ“± Project Overview

The purpose of this final project is to put into practice the tools learned in SE I and SE II. You will build a simple mobile application using the Agile Methodology and DevOps practices. Record the lifecycle of your application and present it in a PowerPoint format in class.

Your mobile application idea should be simple and should require more than one page. It's best if each page has a seperate feature to assign one feature/page per team member.
